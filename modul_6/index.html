				The cat (Felis catus) is a small carnivorous mammal. It is the only domesticated species in
				the family Felidae and often referred to as the domestic cat to distinguish it from wild members of the
				family.
				The cat is either a house
				cat, kept as a pet, or a feral cat, freely ranging and avoiding human contact.[5] A house cat is valued by
				humans for
				companionship and for its ability to hunt rodents. About 60 cat breeds are recognized by various cat
				registries.
			</p>
			<p class="contex-2">
				Cats are similar in anatomy to the other felid species, with a strong flexible body, quick reflexes, sharp
				teeth and
				retractable claws adapted to killing small prey. They are predators who are most active at dawn and dusk
				(crepuscular).
				Cats can hear sounds too faint or too high in frequency for human ears, such as those made by mice and other
				small
				animals. Compared to humans, they see better in the dark (they see in near total darkness) and have a better
				sense of
				smell, but poorer color vision. Cats, despite being solitary hunters, are a social species. Cat
				communication
				includes
				the use of vocalizations including mewing, purring, trilling, hissing, growling and grunting as well as
				cat-specific
				body language.[7] Cats also communicate by secreting and perceiving pheromones.
			</p>
			<p class="contex-3">
				Female domestic cats can have kittens from spring to late autumn, with litter sizes ranging from two to five
				kittens.
				Domestic cats can be bred and shown as registered pedigreed cats, a hobby known as cat fancy. Failure to
				control the
				breeding of pet cats by spaying and neutering, as well as abandonment of pets, has resulted in large numbers
				of
				feral
				cats worldwide, contributing to the extinction of entire bird species, and evoking population control.
